#1. Introduction
--

###Article from the journal *Phonology* [34(2017): 1-40]

--


###&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Title:&lt;/span&gt; "The phonetic specification of contour tones: evidence from Mandarin rising tone"

--


###&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Authors:&lt;/span&gt; Edward Flemming and Hyesun Cho
---

#2. Main Points/Research Question
--

###&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Research Questions&lt;/span&gt;

--

- What is the nature of the phonetic implementation of contour tone?

--

- Which tonal targets are specified in the phonetic module for Mandarin rising tone?

--

###&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Main Points&lt;/span&gt;

--

- Slope, magnitude, alignment targets are *all* specified in phonetic representation of Mandarin contour tone

--

- Rising tone is *overspecified*: each target can be derived from the other two

--

- Targets conflict, resolved through compromise (targets represented as weighted, violable constraints)



---

#3. Explanation of Analysis
--

###&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Experiment&lt;/span&gt;

--

- Production experiment of Mandarin rising tone; four native speaker participants


--

- Two repetitions of stimuli at a baseline speech rate, two at a *faster* speech rate, two at a *slower* speech rate

--

- Examine three possible targets: segmental **anchor** for tones, **magnitude** of rise ([H] - [L]), and average **slope** of rise

--

###&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Hypotheses&lt;/span&gt;

--

- If a subset of the possible targets *does not vary* as a function of speech rate, those are specified in the phonetic module

--

- *Systematic variation* as a function of speech rate indicates non-specification


---

#3. Explanation of Analysis (cont'd)

--

###&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Statistical Analysis&lt;/span&gt;

--

- Test possible candidate anchors for each tone using linear mixed effects models (`lme4::lmer`); anchors with lowest deviance are chosen

--

- Fit linear mixed effects models to evaluate target interaction with speech rate (via syllable duration); include by-speaker random slopes and intercepts

--

  + Residuals (from best fit anchor models) ~ syllable duration

  + Raw/normalized magnitude ~ syllable duration

  + Raw/normalized slope ~ syllable duration

--

- Nested model comparison using Likelihood Ratio Tests

--

  + Eliminate the fixed effect of duration

---

#3. Explanation of Analysis (cont'd)

--

###&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Results&lt;/span&gt;

--

- Model comparisons yield significant effects; all targets **vary systematically** as a function of speech rate

--

  + *Anchors*: decreased duration --&gt; earlier reaching of [L] target/later reaching of [H] target relative to segmental anchor

--

  + *Magnitude*: increased duration --&gt; increase in rise magnitude

--

  + *Slope*: increased duration --&gt; shallowing of average rise slope

--

###&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/span&gt;

--

- No evidence for dividing between specified/unspecified targets (since all varied as a function of duration)

--

- Assume **all are specified**, and develop a constraint-based analysis of phonetic implementation of rising tone (not relevant to statistical analysis, so not discussed here)

---

#4. Appropriateness/Novelty of Analysis

--

###&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Was this the best analysis?&lt;/span&gt;

--

- LME models with nested model comparison common in recent phonetics and experimental phonology work

--

- Well-suited to experiments with multiple responses from subjects (thus violating independence assumption)

--

###&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Did they do something you haven't seen before?&lt;/span&gt;

--

- Calculate the F0 moment corresponding to [L] using the F0 velocity and acceleration

--

- Fit a smoothing spline to the F0 data; implemented in R using `pspline` package


---

#5. Presentation of Results
--

###&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Did they properly/accurately explain their results?&lt;/span&gt;

--

- Provided slope `\(\beta\)`, chi-squared `\(\chi ^2\)`, and *p*-value for each Likelihood Ratio Test

--

- No consistent **experiment-wise alpha** set; reported *p &lt; 0.05*, *p &lt; 0.01*, *p &lt; 0.001* across different tests

--

- No mention of **model diagnostics** such as homoskedasticity or normal distribution of residuals

--

###&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Did they properly/accurately interpret their findings?&lt;/span&gt;

--

- Conclusion that all three targets were specified in the phonetic module in spite of varying systematically as a function of speech rate does not follow from the logic of the hypotheses

--

- Systematic variation is posited as an indicator of *non-specification* in the phonetic module; the conclusion seems contradictory 

---

#5. Presentation of Results (cont'd)
--

###&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Did tables/graphs facilitate interpretation of results?&lt;/span&gt;

--

- Provide multiple plots of the tested targets against syllable duration

--

  + Segmental anchors

--

  + Slope magnitude

--

  + Rise slope
  
--

- Provide mean values and standard deviations in tables where appropriate

--

- Facilitated a clear understanding of the results


---

#6. What You Like/Dislike about the Analysis
--

###&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Like&lt;/span&gt;

--

- Methodologically-rigorous analysis of contour tone with an explicit theory of phonetic implementation in mind

--

- Further development of Flemming's constraint-based model, and application to novel data 

--

###&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Dislike&lt;/span&gt;

--

- Speech rate control in experiment

--

  + Highly-subjective, since subjects were able to choose their own baseline
  
--

  + Should have been more tightly controlled, since it is the main variable of the analysis

--

- Interpretation of results

--

  + Seemed to contradict their hypothesis; if variation with speech rate indicates non-specification, then the three targets do not provide evidence of specification in the phonetic module
